# Evaluation metrics

This repository contains a summary of the article [Evaluation Metrics](https://aman.ai/primers/ai/evaluation-metrics/) from [aman.ai](https://aman.ai/).

We take a look at the evaluation metrics in Deep Learning, such as _accuracy_, _precision_ and _recall_. The folder _Evaluation Metrics for the Classification Problem_ contains a MD file with theory and a Jupyter Notebook with examples of the metrics.

Also, you will find evaluation metrics for _Generative Text Models_, e. g.: BLUE and ROUGE metrics.
